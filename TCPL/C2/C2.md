The C Programming Language Chapter 2 - Types, Operators and Expressions

Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program.

Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are.

Operators specify what is to be done to them.

Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values. The type of an object determines the set of values it
can have and what operations can be performed on it.

**2.1 Variable Names**

  Names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be a letter.
  
  The underscore ``_'' counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for improving the readability of long variable names. 
  
  Don't begin variable names with underscore, however, since library routines often use such names. Upper and lower case 
  letters are distinct, so x and X are two different names.
  
  Traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for symbolic constants. 
  
  At least the first 31 characters of an internal name are significant.
  
  For function names and external variables, the number may be less than 31, because external names may be used by
  assemblers and loaders over which the language has no control.
  
  For external names, the standard guarantees uniqueness only for 6 characters and a single case.
  
  Keywords like `if`, `else`, `int`, `float`, etc., are reserved: you can't use them as variable names. They must be in 
  lower case. 

  It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the purpose of the variable, and that are unlikely to get mixed 
  up typographically.
