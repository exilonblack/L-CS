The C Programming Language Chapter 2 - Types, Operators and Expressions

Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program.

Declarations list the variables to be used, and state what type they have and perhaps what their initial values are.

Operators specify what is to be done to them.

Expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values. The type of an object determines the set of values it
can have and what operations can be performed on it.

**2.1 Variable Names**

  Names are made up of letters and digits; the first character must be a letter.
  
  The underscore ``_'' counts as a letter; it is sometimes useful for improving the readability of long variable names. 
  
  Don't begin variable names with underscore, however, since library routines often use such names. Upper and lower case 
  letters are distinct, so x and X are two different names.
  
  Traditional C practice is to use lower case for variable names, and all upper case for symbolic constants. 
  
  At least the first 31 characters of an internal name are significant.
  
  For function names and external variables, the number may be less than 31, because external names may be used by
  assemblers and loaders over which the language has no control.
  
  For external names, the standard guarantees uniqueness only for 6 characters and a single case.
  
  Keywords like `if`, `else`, `int`, `float`, etc., are reserved: you can't use them as variable names. They must be in 
  lower case. 

  It's wise to choose variable names that are related to the purpose of the variable, and that are unlikely to get mixed 
  up typographically.
  
  **2.2 Data Types and Sizes**

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>Type</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`char`</td>
      <td>a single byte, capable of holding one character in the local character set</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`int`</td>
      <td>an integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`float`</td>
      <td>single-precision floating point</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`double`</td>
      <td>double-precision floating point</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  
  In addition, there are a number of qualifiers that can be applied to these basic types. short and long apply to 
  integers: 
 
    short int sh;
    long int counter;
    
  The word int can be omitted in such declarations, and typically it is.
  
  The intent is that short and long should provide different lengths of integers where practical; `int` will normally be
  the natural size for a particular machine.
  
  `short` is often 16 bits long, and `int` either 16 or 32 bits.
  
  Each compiler is free to choose appropriate sizes for its own hardware, subject only to the the restriction that 
  `short`s and `int`s are at least 16 bits, `longs` are at least 32 bits, and `short` is no longer than `int`, which is no
  longer  than `long`. 

  The qualifier `signed` or `unsigned` may be applied to `char` or any integer. `unsigned` numbers are always positive or 
  zero, and obey the laws of arithmetic modulo `2^n`, where `n` is the number of bits in the type.
  
  So, for instance, if `chars` are 8 bits, `unsigned` char variables have values between 0 and 255, while `signed` chars 
  have values between -128 and 127 (in a two's complement machine.)
  
  Whether plain chars are signed or unsigned is machine-dependent, but printable characters are always positive. 

  The type `long double` specifies extended-precision floating point. As with integers, the sizes of floating-point 
  objects are implementation-defined; `float`, `double` and `long double` could represent one, two or three distinct 
  sizes. 
  
  The standard headers `<limits.h>` and `<float.h>` contain symbolic constants for all of these sizes, along with other 
  properties of the machine and compiler.
