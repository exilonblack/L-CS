Learning-Computer Science

**What's L-CS?**
  
L-CS is an acronym for Learning-Computer Science. I added a hyphen to separate 'Learning' and 'Computer Science'. It's a personal repository containing exercise solutions, programs, my notes and reflections for each chapter on books, video tutorials, online courses, etc.,.
  
**Why make L-CS?**

I decided to write about my experience and it's `kinda my way to express exilonblack's (my alias) persona.

**Do you have a plan to learn Computer Science?**

  Yes. I plan to start from the very beginning, from relatively easy to increasingly difficult path. I think I'll add a 'Programming rank' for this. You'll see the whole plan in the plan section. (Specifically PLAN2014.md for the beginning)
  
**Do you got some sort of design/template for the contents?**
  (5/9/14) Not yet... But I'll make some as time progresses.
