Learning-Computer Science

**What's L-CS?**
  
L-CS is an acronym for Learning-Computer Science. I added a hyphen to separate 'Learning' and 'Computer Science'. It's a personal repository containing exercise solutions, programs, my notes and reflections for each chapter on books, video tutorials, online courses, etc.,.
  
**Why make L-CS?**

I decided to write about my experience and it's `kinda my way to express exilonblack's (my alias) persona.

**Do you have a plan to learn Computer Science?**

  Nope. I just read ebooks, post my reflections, notes, and programs and my exercise solutions. At a later time, I'll make
  a user site for all of this soon...
  
**Do you got some sort of design/template for the contents?**
  
  Not yet... But I'll make some as time progresses. (5/9/14)
  
**Do you have any assumptions the readers *might* know?**
  
  A knowledge of what they're going to read since the contents are my reflections, notes, programs, and exercise solutions.
  
  Powershell is recommended since you'll see prompts, commands, and file locations but it's not necessary, you may ignore it
  since it's just for show.

**How would you define *computer science*?**
  I would define computer science as the science (or study) of computers, not only the course in college but also how
  it should be used.
