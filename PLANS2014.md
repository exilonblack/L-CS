**TCPL Plan: Learning the programming fundamentals with C (5/19/14)**

  The C Programming Language is a book that teaches C made by Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kerningham. I plan to learn all of the programming fundamentals in this book since C is mostly faster and straight to the point.
  
  I plan to complete each chapters by writing notes and reflections in it, solve the exercises and share it here, and write all the code and save it in this repository. In that way, I can refer to it easily and be able to differentiate what I am now and what I will be in the days to come.
  
  I got the ebook [here](http://www.iups.org/media/meeting_minutes/C.pdf). this ebook is also available in the TCPL folder.
  
  **Folder name:** TCPL
  
  **Plan Completed on:** On-going
  
  **What I learned:** Nothing yet.
